# Heart Disease Prediction Project

This repository contains a machine learning project developed during my exchange program at Hochschule Karlsruhe in Germany. The project focuses on predicting the likelihood of heart disease based on patient data using various machine learning techniques.


**Overview**

The goal of this project is to apply machine learning models to analyze and predict heart disease, utilizing data preprocessing, visualization, and predictive algorithms. It was created as part of the Machine Learning with Python lecture.

Special thanks to Sarah Haq for her guidance and knowledge throughout the course. You can find her GitHub profile and the course repository below:

**How to Run**

1. Open the Jupyter notebook provided in the repository and execute the cells to train and evaluate the models. Once you decide on the best-performing model, save it using joblib.

  NOTE: Make sure to install the following Python libraries using pip before running the app:

  pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn sklearn xgboost joblib


2. After saving the model, navigate to the src folder in your terminal or command prompt.


3. Run the following command to start the Streamlit app:

streamlit run app.py


**Project Features**

- Data Processing: Efficiently handles the preprocessing of heart disease data for machine learning models.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Includes detailed visualizations and statistical insights to uncover patterns and relationships in the dataset.
- Model Training and Evaluation: Implements multiple machine learning models and evaluates their performance metrics.
- Model Deployment: Integrates a user-friendly Streamlit application for predicting heart disease based on user input.
- Model Persistence: Uses joblib for saving and loading trained models efficiently.


**This project reflects my ability to:**

- Analyze and process large datasets for machine learning tasks.
- Build and compare predictive models to derive meaningful results.
- Create interactive applications for real-world use cases.
- Leverage Python libraries such as Pandas, Scikit-learn, and XGBoost effectively.
- Apply concepts learned during my exchange program in Germany to practical problems.
