# Heart Disease Prediction Project

This repository contains the code for a project on predicting heart disease, developed during a Machine Learning with Python lecture course at Hoschule Karlsruhe, Germany.

**Project Goal**

This project aims to develop a model to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on certain risk factors.

**Getting Started**

1. **Prerequisites:**
    - Python 3.x
2. **Installation:**
    Clone this repository and navigate to the project directory.
    Install the required libraries using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn sklearn xgboost joblib
    ```
3. **Running the App:**
    Open a command prompt (cmd) in the `src` folder and run:
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```
    This will launch the web app for heart disease prediction.

**Libraries Used**

* pandas: Data manipulation and analysis
* numpy: Numerical computations
* matplotlib: Visualization
* seaborn: Advanced data visualization
* sklearn: Machine learning library
* xgboost: Gradient boosting framework for machine learning
* joblib: Persistance of objects

**Further Resources**

* Sarah Haq's Github profile: https://github.com/shaq31415926
* Course repository: https://github.com/shaq31415926/ip302

**Additional Notes**

* Consider adding a brief explanation of the data used and the model's performance.
* You can also include instructions on how to use the web app for prediction (if applicable).




is this a good readme for a project that I made?

# Heart Disease Prediction

This repo contains code from my Machine Learning with Python lecture coursed during my Exchange with Hoschule Karlsruhe in Germany.

I would like to thank Sarah Haq for the knowlegde teached during the classes.

To run the app it is necessary to open a cmd in the src folder and run the line:
streamlit run app.py

Necessary libraries that must be installed:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- sklearn
- xgboost
- joblib
